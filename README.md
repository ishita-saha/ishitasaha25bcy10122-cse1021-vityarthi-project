Here are 34 programs with their proper python code, output and snapshots. 
Project Goal: The project aims to implement a comprehensive library of computational mathematics and number theory functions. The programs are divided into 8files.

Code 1 to 5: Based on Basic Arithmetic and Digital Properties like: factorial(n) is_palindrome(n) mean_of_digits(n) digital_root(n) is_abundant(n) These codes use the concept of basic recursion, string manipulation, digit extration and statistics, modulo arithematic, divisibilty.

Code 6 to 10: This module introduces concepts of proper divisors and initial factorization techniques. is_deficient(n) is_harshad(n) is_automorphic(n) is_pronic(n) prime_factors(n) These codes use the concept of divisbilty, digit sum, powers and suffixes, square roots/integer check, factorization algorithm.

Code 11 to 15: This module focuses on functions specifically related to prime numbers, their counts, and specific prime forms. count_distinct_prime_factors(n) is_prime_power(n) is_mersenne_prime(p) twin_primes(limit) count_divisors(n) These codes use the concept of factorization, logarithms, large prime testing,sieve method,divisor function.

Code 16 to 20: This module deals with advanced divisor properties and iterative processes. aliquot_sum(n) are_amicable(a, b) multiplicative_persistence(n) is_highly_composite(n) mod_exp(base, exponent, modulus) These codes use the concept of divisor summation, aliquot sum application,iterative digit multiplication, maximising divisor count, exponentiation by squaring.

Code 21 to 25: This module focuses on essential algorithms used in cryptography and advanced number theory. mod_inverse(a, m) crt(remainders, moduli) is_quadratic_residue(a, p) order_mod(a, n) is_fibonacci_prime(n) These programs use the concept of extended euclidean algorithm, chinese remainder theorem, legendre symbol/euler's criterion, modular order, fibonacci sequence.

Code 26 to 30: This module covers specific mathematical sequences and checks for historically significant numbers. lucas_sequence(n) lucas_sequence(n) collatz_length(n) polygonal_number(s, n) is_carmichael(n) These programs use the concept of linear recurrence relation, root finding, iterative sequence, closed-form formula, fermat's little theorem(pseudoprimes).

Code 31 to 34: The final module requires implementing complex, high-level algorithms central to computation and analytical number theory. is_prime_miller_rabin(n, k) pollard_rho(n) zeta_approx(s, terms) partition_function(n) These programs use the concept of probabilistic primality testing, factorization algorithm,infinite series approximation, recurssion.
